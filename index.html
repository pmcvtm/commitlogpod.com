    <p>
      When it's time to share their work, developers make a <strong>commit</strong> to a repository which
      contains everyone's changes in succession. Together these commits tell a story about who's involved,
      when they're working, and what they were thinking. When it's time to hear that shared story, other
      developers can look at <strong>The Commit Log</strong> to the scoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Host <a href="https://loudandabrasive.com/about">Patrick McVeety-Mill</a> interviews guests about their workday: what are they doing,
      when are they doing it, who they do it with, and what hurts and helps throughout it.

  <h2>In Search of Guests!</h2>
    <p>
      The Commit Log is getting up and running and we're in search of guests to interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you work in, adjacent to, or around technology and are comfortable talking
      about how you work and what you do throughout the day, give us a shout.
